#Sublime-GoogleScholar
This is a sublime package that provides a facility to interact with Google Scholar without leaving Sublime.

Install the package from this repo into Sublime, then use the Command Pallette (cmd + shift + P), then search for "GoogleSchoalr". There are two commands: "Search Highlighted" and "Insert your term". Both of them give you a list of the titiles from Google scholar and a list of commands for each paper including: go to, sub-title, number of citation, go to citation, go to related articles, other versions and intergration with [DBLP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DBLP).

###Dependencies:
phantomjs: install by `pip install phantomjs`

[DBLP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DBLP)


This package should be used with Google Scholar access limit in mind. If you got a message with "no results", you are most probably have hit the limit!
